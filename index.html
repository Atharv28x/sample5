<p id="p">Drawing is something I enjoy doing in my free time and it is my favourite hobby.When I was 5 years old, I loved     to play with colors.Since then, my love for drawing and painting has increased.At first, I was just using colors to       paint. I used just to draw some random pictures. I used to draw something every day. That is how I developed my           drawing skills.I can draw anything which is in my mind. I can express my thoughts through drawing. I draw various         things.</p>
